Black screen bug repo:

Unity 2019.1.4f1

Oculus SDK 1.38


How to reproduce:

Open the build while not wearing the headset

Headset doesn't go into pause like it was before so it updates everything in computer display 

Press SPACE to load another scene without wearing the headset. After loading scene if you will put headset on you will get black screen inside headset but computer display will render everything.

If doing all the same while wearing the headset everything is fine. 

We suspect that might have something to do with our multi-cam setup, but can't understand why headset doesn't go into pause while not on the head anymore.
