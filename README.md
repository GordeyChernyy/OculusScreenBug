Black screen bug repo:

Unity 2019.1.4f1

Oculus SDK 1.38


How to reproduce:

Open the build while not wearing the headset

Headset doesn't go into pause like it was before 

Press SPACE to load another scene

screen is now black


If doing all the same while wearing the headset everything is fine. 

We suspect that might have something to do with our multi-cam setup, but can't understand why headset doesn't go into pause while not on the head anymore.
